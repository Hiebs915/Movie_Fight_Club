# Movie Comparison App

This project was put together to learn more about dynamically building HTML using function responses and more importantly, making API calls to omdbapi.com.  It was built because I enjoy watching movies and enjoy looking up their stats while watching them.

## Instructions
After entering two movies the app will automatically compare the IMDB stats of the two movies and highlight a "winner".

## Example
When you load up the page you will have two search fields.  The two searches pull data from the omdb api.  Once two of your favorite movies are selected the app will automatically highlight the stats between the two movies and identify your winner.  Give it a try!
