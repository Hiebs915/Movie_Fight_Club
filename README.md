# Movie Comparison App

This project was put together to learn more about dynamically building HTML using function responses and making API calls to omdbapi.com.  It was built because I enjoy watching movies and enjoy looking up their stats while watching them.

After entering two movies the app will automatically compare the IMDB stats of the two movies and highlight a "winner".
